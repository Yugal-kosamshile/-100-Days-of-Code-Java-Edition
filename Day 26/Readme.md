# Day 26: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

## 📝 Description

On Day 26 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I created a Java program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. GCD is the largest number that can divide both numbers without leaving a remainder.

### **Objective:**
- Practice the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD.
- Understand how modulus operation works in calculating GCD.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. Uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD by repeatedly applying the modulus operation.
3. Outputs the GCD of the two numbers.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Euclidean algorithm for GCD calculation.
- Arithmetic operations like division and modulus.
- Basic looping and conditionals in Java.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day26/`
  - `greatestCommonDivisor.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac greatestCommonDivisor.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java greatestCommonDivisor
   ```
3. **Input two numbers** when prompted, and the program will display the GCD.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter first number: 54
Enter second number: 24
The GCD of 54 and 24 is: 6
```

**Day 26 complete!** Looking forward to the next challenge!
