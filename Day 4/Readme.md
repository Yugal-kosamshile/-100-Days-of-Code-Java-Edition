# Day 4: Total Cost with 18% GST

## üìù Description

On Day 4 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that calculates the total cost of three items including an 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST).

### **Objective:**
- Learn to handle user input for multiple values.
- Calculate tax and total cost using arithmetic operations.

## üöÄ Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter the cost of three items: Pencil, Pen, and Eraser.
2. Calculates the GST at 18% on the total cost of the items.
3. Computes the final total cost by adding the GST to the sum of the item costs.
4. Outputs the total cost including GST.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Taking multiple user inputs with the `Scanner` class.
- Arithmetic operations for tax calculation.
- Printing results to the console.

## üìÇ File Structure
- `Day 4/`
  - `totalCost.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## üìã How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac totalCost.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java totalCost
   ```
3. **Input the costs** of Pencil, Pen, and Eraser when prompted to see the total cost including 18% GST.

## üîç Example Output

```plaintext
Cost of Pencil : 10
Cost of Pen : 15
Cost of Eraser : 5
The total cost of the items with 18% tax : 39.0
```
