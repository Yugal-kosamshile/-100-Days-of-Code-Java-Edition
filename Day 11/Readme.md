# Day 11: Keep Entering Numbers Until a Multiple of 10

## 📝 Description

On Day 11 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that continuously prompts the user to enter numbers until they enter a multiple of 10. This exercise reinforces the use of loops and conditional statements in Java.

### **Objective:**
- Practice using loops to repeatedly ask for user input.
- Implement a condition to break out of the loop when a specific requirement is met (in this case, entering a multiple of 10).

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Continuously prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Checks if the entered number is a multiple of 10 using the modulus operator (`%`).
3. If the number is a multiple of 10, the program displays a message and terminates.
4. If not, it continues to ask for another number.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Using the `do-while` loop for repeated execution until a condition is met.
- Conditional logic with `if-else` statements.
- User input handling with the `Scanner` class.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day11/`
  - `multipleOF_10.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac multipleOF_10.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java multipleOF_10
   ```
3. **Enter numbers** when prompted until you input a multiple of 10.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the number: 25
25 is not a multiple of 10
Enter the number: 40
40 is a multiple of 10.
```
