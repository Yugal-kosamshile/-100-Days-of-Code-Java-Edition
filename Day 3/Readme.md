# Day 3: Check Temperature

## 📝 Description

On Day 3 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a simple Java program that checks a given temperature and determines if it indicates a fever.

### **Objective:**
- Understand how to use conditional statements in Java.
- Practice basic comparison operations.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Stores a temperature value in a variable.
2. Uses an `if-else` statement to check if the temperature is above 100°F.
3. Outputs whether the user has a fever or not based on the temperature.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Conditional statements (`if-else`).
- Basic comparison operators.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 3/`
  - `CheckTemp.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac CheckTemp.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java CheckTemp
   ```
3. **View the output** to see if the temperature indicates a fever.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
You have a fever.
```
