# Day 42: Find the Largest and Smallest Number in an Array

## 📝 Description

On Day 42 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to find the largest and smallest number in an array. This program reads an array of integers and determines both the largest and smallest numbers.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to loop through an array and compare values.
- Practice array manipulation and conditional statements in Java.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts an array of integers from the user.
2. Loops through the array to find the largest and smallest numbers.
3. Displays the largest and smallest numbers after evaluating the array.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Array traversal using loops.
- Conditional statements to find the minimum and maximum values.
- User input handling.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 42/`
  - `LargestAndSmallestInArray.java`: The main Java program to find the largest and smallest number in an array.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac LargestAndSmallestInArray.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java LargestAndSmallestInArray
   ```
3. **Enter an array of integers** to see the largest and smallest values.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 5
Enter the elements of the array: 3 5 7 2 8
Largest number: 8
Smallest number: 2
```
