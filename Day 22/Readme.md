# Day 22: Reverse a String

## 📝 Description

On Day 22 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that takes a string input from the user and reverses it. This exercise helped reinforce string manipulation and looping techniques in Java.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to reverse a string using loops.
- Understand how to manipulate strings and access individual characters.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to input a string.
2. Iterates over the string in reverse order and constructs a new reversed string.
3. Prints the reversed string.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- `for` loop for iterating through the string.
- String manipulation by appending characters in reverse order.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day22/`
  - `ReverseString.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac ReverseString.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java ReverseString
   ```
3. **Enter a string** when prompted to see the reversed version.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter a String: hello
Reversed String is: olleh
```
