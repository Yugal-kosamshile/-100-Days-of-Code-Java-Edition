# Day 7: Positive or Negative Number

## 📝 Description

On Day 7 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that determines whether a number provided by the user is positive or negative.

### **Objective:**
- Learn to handle user input.
- Implement conditional logic to classify numbers.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. Checks if the number is greater than zero (positive) or less than zero (negative).
3. Outputs whether the number is positive or negative.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Taking user input with the `Scanner` class.
- Conditional statements (`if-else`).
- Outputting results to the console.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 7/`
  - `positive_negative.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac positive_negative.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java positive_negative
   ```
3. **Input a number** when prompted to see if it is positive or negative.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter a number: -5
-5 is a Negative number
```
