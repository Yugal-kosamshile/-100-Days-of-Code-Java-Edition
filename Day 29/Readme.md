# Day 29: Find the Largest and Smallest Number in an Array

## 📝 Description

On Day 29 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that finds both the largest and smallest numbers in an array provided by the user. This task reinforces concepts of arrays and loop structures in Java.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to traverse an array and determine the minimum and maximum values.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts an array of integers from the user.
2. Iterates through the array to find the largest and smallest numbers.
3. Displays both the largest and smallest numbers.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Arrays and their manipulation in Java.
- Using `for` loops to traverse and inspect each element in an array.
- Conditional logic to compare and find values.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day29/`
  - `LargestSmallestInArray.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac LargestSmallestInArray.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java LargestSmallestInArray
   ```
3. **Input an array** of integers when prompted.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the size of the array: 5
Enter 5 numbers: 3 9 1 5 7
The largest number is: 9
The smallest number is: 1
```
