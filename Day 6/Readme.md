# Day 6: Basic Calculator

## 📝 Description

On Day 6 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that functions as a simple calculator. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

### **Objective:**
- Practice using `switch` statements in Java.
- Handle user input and perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter two integers (`a` and `b`).
2. Asks the user to choose an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
3. Uses a `switch` statement to perform the selected operation and prints the result.
4. Displays an error message if an invalid operator is entered.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- `switch` statements for decision-making.
- User input handling with the `Scanner` class.
- Basic arithmetic operations in Java.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day6/`
  - `Calculator.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java Calculator
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** to enter values and select an operator.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the value of a: 10
Enter the value of b: 5
Enter the operator: *
The multiplication of a * b is : 50
```
