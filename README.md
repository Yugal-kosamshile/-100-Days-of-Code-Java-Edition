# 100 Days of Coding Challenge: Java Edition

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge! This repository is where I document my journey of learning and improving my Java programming skills over the course of 100 days. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenge Overview

- **Challenge End Date:** 25-08-2024
- **Challenge End Date:** "will see..."
- **Primary Language:** Java
- **Total Days:** 100
- **Objective:** Enhance my Java programming skills by coding daily and solving various problems, building projects, and exploring different aspects of the language.

## üìÖ Daily Log

Every day, I'll be adding a new folder corresponding to that day's challenge. Each folder will contain the following:

- **Code Files:** The Java files created during the day.
- **README.md:** Explanation of the code, the problem it solves, and the approach used.
- **Output.txt:** Sample output or results from running the code (if applicable).

## üß† What I Aim to Learn

- **Core Java Concepts:** Deepen my understanding of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), data structures, and algorithms.
- **Problem-Solving:** Improve my ability to solve problems efficiently using Java.
- **Project Building:** Work on small projects to apply what I've learned in practical scenarios.
- **Best Practices:** Follow clean code principles, write readable and maintainable code, and implement industry-standard practices.

## üöÄ Why I'm Doing This

Coding consistently every day helps solidify concepts and improves problem-solving skills. This challenge is not just about learning Java but also about building a strong discipline in programming. By the end of this challenge, I aim to be proficient in Java and confident in tackling more complex projects.

## üíª Tools and Technologies

- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS code)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Languages:** Java (with possible inclusion of libraries/frameworks)
