# 100 Days of Coding Challenge: Java Edition

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge! This repository is where I document my journey of learning and improving my Java programming skills over the course of 100 days. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenge Overview

- **Challenge End Date:** 25-08-2024
- **Challenge End Date:** "will see..."
- **Primary Language:** Java
- **Total Days:** 100
- **Objective:** Enhance my Java programming skills by coding daily and solving various problems, building projects, and exploring different aspects of the language.

## üìÖ Daily Log

Every day, I'll be adding a new folder corresponding to that day's challenge. Each folder will contain the following:

- **Code Files:** The Java files created during the day.
- **README.md:** Explanation of the code, the problem it solves, and the approach used.
- **Output.txt:** Sample output or results from running the code (if applicable).
- **Notes.md:** Any additional learnings, challenges faced, or resources used.

| 1   | Average of Three inputs | Completed | [Day 1](./Day%201) |
| 2   | Area of a Square | Completed | [Day 2](./Day%202) |
| 3   | Check Temperature | Completed | [Day 3](./Day%203) |
| 4   | Total Cost with 18% GST | Completed | [Day 4](./Day%204) |
| 5   | Relational Operators | Completed | [Day 5](./Day%205) |
| 6   | Basic Calculator | Completed | [Day 6](./Day%206) |
| 7   | Positive or Negative Number| Completed | [Day 7](./Day%207) |
| 8   | Leap Year Checker |Completed | [Day 8](./Day%208) |
| 9   | Reverse of a Given Number | Completed | [Day 9](./Day%209) |
| 10  | [Your Day 10 Topic] | --------- | [Day 10](./Day%2010)|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 100 | Final Project | Planned | [Day 100](./Day100) |

## üß† What I Aim to Learn

- **Core Java Concepts:** Deepen my understanding of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), data structures, and algorithms.
- **Problem-Solving:** Improve my ability to solve problems efficiently using Java.
- **Project Building:** Work on small projects to apply what I've learned in practical scenarios.
- **Best Practices:** Follow clean code principles, write readable and maintainable code, and implement industry-standard practices.

## üöÄ Why I'm Doing This

Coding consistently every day helps solidify concepts and improves problem-solving skills. This challenge is not just about learning Java but also about building a strong discipline in programming. By the end of this challenge, I aim to be proficient in Java and confident in tackling more complex projects.

## üíª Tools and Technologies

- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS code)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Languages:** Java (with possible inclusion of libraries/frameworks)

## üìù How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/100-Days-of-Code-Java.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to a Day's Folder:**
   Each day's folder is structured to help you understand the problem solved and the code written.

3. **Run the Code:**
   Compile and run the Java files using your preferred IDE or command line.

## üéØ Goals

- **Consistency:** Code every day for 100 days, no exceptions.
- **Learning:** Improve Java proficiency through hands-on coding.
- **Sharing:** Document the journey on GitHub for others to follow along and learn from.
