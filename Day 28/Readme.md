# Day 28: Generate Random Numbers and Sort Them

## 📝 Description

On Day 28 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I created a Java program that generates random numbers and sorts them. This challenge helped reinforce concepts related to arrays, loops, and sorting algorithms.

### **Objective:**
- Generate a specified number of random integers.
- Store these integers in an array.
- Sort the array in ascending order using a simple sorting algorithm.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Generates random integers using `Math.random()` or `Random` class.
2. Stores these random numbers in an array.
3. Implements a sorting algorithm (such as Bubble Sort) to arrange the numbers in ascending order.
4. Prints the sorted list of numbers.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Arrays for storing numbers.
- Using the `Random` class to generate random numbers.
- Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort.
- Loops and array manipulation.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day28/`
  - `RandomNumberSorter.java`: The main Java program that generates and sorts random numbers.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac RandomNumberSorter.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java RandomNumberSorter
   ```
3. Enter the number of random numbers you'd like to generate when prompted.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of random numbers to generate: 5
Generated random numbers: [14, 7, 23, 5, 17]
Sorted numbers: [5, 7, 14, 17, 23]
```
