# Day 2: Area of a Square

## 📝 Description

On Day 2 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that calculates the area of a square based on the side length provided by the user.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to take user input in Java.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations to calculate the area of a square.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter the side length of a square.
2. Calculates the area using the formula `Area = side × side`.
3. Outputs the calculated area to the console.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Taking user input with the `Scanner` class.
- Arithmetic operations to calculate area.
- Printing results to the console.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 2/`
  - `SqrArea.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac SqrArea.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java SqrArea
   ```
3. **Input the side length of the square** when prompted to see the calculated area.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
The Side of Square
5
Area of Square is: 25
```
