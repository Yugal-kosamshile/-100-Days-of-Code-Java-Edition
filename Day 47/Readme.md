# Day 47: Find the Mode of an Array

## 📝 Description

On Day 47 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to find the mode of an array. The mode is the element that appears most frequently in the array. If multiple numbers share the same highest frequency, all of them are considered modes.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to count occurrences of elements in an array.
- Practice using data structures (like hashmaps) to solve frequency problems efficiently.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts an array of integers from the user.
2. Uses a hashmap to count the frequency of each element in the array.
3. Finds the element(s) with the highest frequency and displays the mode(s).

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Using hashmaps to store and retrieve element frequencies.
- Traversing arrays and finding maximum frequency values.
- Handling cases with multiple modes.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 47/`
  - `FindModeOfArray.java`: The main Java program to find the mode of an array.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac FindModeOfArray.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java FindModeOfArray
   ```
3. **Enter an array of integers** to see the mode(s).

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 7
Enter the elements of the array: 1 3 3 5 7 3 5
The mode(s) is/are: 3
```

If there are multiple modes:
```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 6
Enter the elements of the array: 2 4 2 5 4 5
The mode(s) is/are: 2 4 5
```
