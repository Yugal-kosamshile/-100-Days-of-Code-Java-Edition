# Day 44: Reverse an Array

## 📝 Description

On Day 44 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to reverse the elements of an array. This program reads an array of integers and reverses the order of the elements.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to reverse an array in place.
- Practice array manipulation and swapping elements.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts an array of integers from the user.
2. Reverses the elements of the array.
3. Displays the reversed array.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Array traversal and element swapping.
- Reversing arrays in place with minimal additional space.
- Efficient array manipulation using loops.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 44/`
  - `ReverseArray.java`: The main Java program to reverse an array.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac ReverseArray.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java ReverseArray
   ```
3. **Enter an array of integers** to see the array reversed.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 5
Enter the elements of the array: 1 2 3 4 5
Reversed array: 5 4 3 2 1
```
