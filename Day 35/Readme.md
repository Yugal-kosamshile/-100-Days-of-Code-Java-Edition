# Day 35: Check if a Binary Search Tree (BST) is Balanced

## 📝 Description

On Day 35 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to check if a Binary Search Tree (BST) is balanced. A balanced BST is defined as one in which the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is not more than 1.

### **Objective:**
- Understand the concept of a balanced Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Implement a program to check if a given BST is balanced.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Defines a `Node` class to represent a node in the BST.
2. Constructs a BST by allowing users to input node values.
3. Recursively checks if the BST is balanced by calculating the heights of subtrees and comparing their difference.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Binary Search Trees (BST).
- Tree traversal and recursion.
- Height calculation of a tree and balancing conditions.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 35/`
  - `BalancedBST.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac BalancedBST.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java BalancedBST
   ```
3. **Input the node values** to construct the BST and check if it is balanced.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
The tree is balanced.
```
