# Day 1: Average of Three Inputs

## 📝 Description

On Day 1 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a simple Java program that calculates the average of three input numbers provided by the user.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to take user input in Java.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Output the result to the console.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter three numbers.
2. Calculates the average of the three numbers.
3. Displays the result.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Taking input using the `Scanner` class.
- Basic arithmetic operations.
- Printing output to the console.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day01/`
  - `AverageOfThree.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac AverageOfThree.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java AverageOfThree
   ```
3. **Input three numbers** when prompted to see the calculated average.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter Value of a : 55
Enter Value of b : 66
Enter Value of c : 33
The Average of the a, b & c is : 51
```
