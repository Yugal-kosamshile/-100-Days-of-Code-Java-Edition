# Day 13: Factorial of any Number

## 📝 Description

On Day 13 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user. This exercise focuses on using loops to perform repetitive multiplication, which is essential in calculating factorials.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to use loops to perform iterative calculations.
- Understand the concept of factorial and how it applies to numbers.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Calculates the factorial of the entered number using a loop.
   - The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers up to `n`.
   - It is represented as `n!` and calculated as `n * (n-1) * ... * 2 * 1`.
3. Outputs the factorial of the entered number.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Loops (`for` loop) in Java for iterative calculations.
- Working with large numbers using the `long` data type to store the factorial value.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day13/`
  - `factorial.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac factorial.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java factorial
   ```
3. **Enter a number** when prompted to find its factorial.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```
