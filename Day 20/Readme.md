# Day 20: Palindrome Checker

## 📝 Description

On Day 20 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I focused on writing a Java program to check whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward as it does backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

### **Objective:**
- Practice string manipulation in Java.
- Learn how to reverse a string and compare it with the original.
- Handle both case sensitivity and non-alphabetic characters effectively.

## 🚀 Code Overview

The program prompts the user to enter a string. It then removes any spaces and converts the string to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. The string is reversed and compared with the original to check if it is a palindrome. Finally, the result is displayed to the user.

### **1. Palindrome Checker**

This program checks if a string is a palindrome using the following steps:
1. Convert the string to lowercase.
2. Remove spaces or special characters.
3. Reverse the string.
4. Compare the original and reversed string.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day20/`
  - `PalindromeChecker.java`: Contains the Java program to check if a string is a palindrome.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac PalindromeChecker.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java PalindromeChecker
   ```
3. **Input the string when prompted.**

## 🔍 Example Output

### **Example 1:**
```plaintext
Enter a string: Racecar
The string is a palindrome.
```

### **Example 2:**
```plaintext
Enter a string: Hello
The string is not a palindrome.
```
