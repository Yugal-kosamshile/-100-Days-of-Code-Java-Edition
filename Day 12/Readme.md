# Day 12: Check if a Number is Prime or Not

## 📝 Description

On Day 12 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to determine whether a given number is a prime number. This exercise focuses on using loops and conditional logic to implement a basic prime-checking algorithm.

### **Objective:**
- Understand the concept of prime numbers.
- Implement a loop to check divisibility and determine if a number is prime.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Checks if the number is prime:
   - A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
   - The program checks divisibility from 2 up to the number minus 1.
3. Outputs whether the entered number is prime or not.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Loops (`for` loop) in Java for iterating through potential divisors.
- Conditional statements (`if-else`) to decide if the number is prime.
- Understanding basic number theory concepts like prime numbers.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day12/`
  - `primeNo.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac primeNo.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java primeNo
   ```
3. **Enter a number** when prompted to check if it is prime.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter your number: 17
17 is a prime number.
```
