# Day 14: Sum of First n Natural Numbers

## 📝 Description

On Day 14 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I developed a Java program to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. This exercise reinforces the use of loops and arithmetic operations in Java.

### **Objective:**
- Practice using loops to perform repetitive tasks.
- Understand how to accumulate sums over a series of natural numbers.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter a value for `n`.
2. Calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using a `while` loop.
3. Outputs the sum to the user.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- `while` loop for repeated summation.
- Basic arithmetic operations for accumulating totals.
- User input handling with `Scanner`.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day14/`
  - `sumof_n.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac sumof_n.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java sumof_n
   ```
3. **Enter the value of `n`** when prompted to see the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the value of n: 5
The sum of the first 5 natural numbers is: 15
```
