# Day 30: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers

## 📝 Description

On Day 30 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, where `n` is provided by the user.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to calculate the sum of natural numbers using a loop.
- Practice taking user input in Java and working with basic control structures.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter a positive integer `n`.
2. Uses a loop to calculate the sum of all natural numbers up to `n`.
3. Outputs the result to the console.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Taking user input with the `Scanner` class.
- Looping structures to calculate the sum.
- Printing results to the console.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 30/`
  - `SumOfNaturalNumbers.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac SumOfNaturalNumbers.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java SumOfNaturalNumbers
   ```
3. **Input a positive integer** when prompted to see the calculated sum of the natural numbers.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter a positive integer: 
5
The sum of natural numbers up to 5 is: 15
```
