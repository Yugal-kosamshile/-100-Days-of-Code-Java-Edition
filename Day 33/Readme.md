# Day 33: Check if Two Strings are Anagrams

## 📝 Description

On Day 33 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to check if two strings are anagrams. Two strings are considered anagrams if they contain the same characters in the same frequencies, but in any order.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to compare two strings to determine if they are anagrams.
- Practice string manipulation and sorting techniques in Java.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter two strings.
2. Converts both strings to lowercase and removes any spaces.
3. Sorts the characters in both strings.
4. Compares the sorted strings to check if they are anagrams.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- String manipulation (lowercasing, removing spaces).
- Sorting arrays of characters.
- Comparing strings to check for equality.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 33/`
  - `AnagramCheck.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac AnagramCheck.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java AnagramCheck
   ```
3. **Input two strings** to see if they are anagrams.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the first string: 
listen
Enter the second string: 
silent
The two strings are anagrams.
```
