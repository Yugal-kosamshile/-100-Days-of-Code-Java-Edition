# Day 41: Print a Diamond & Butterfly Pattern

## 📝 Description

On Day 41 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I implemented two interesting pattern-printing programs in Java: a **Diamond Pattern** and a **Butterfly Pattern**. These patterns involve nested loops and are a great way to practice control over loops and formatting in Java.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to print symmetrical patterns using nested loops.
- Practice aligning characters and creating mirrored structures.
- Improve skills in working with loops and conditional statements.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Takes the number of rows as input.
2. Generates and prints both the **Diamond Pattern** and **Butterfly Pattern**.
3. Each pattern is printed based on the specified number of rows.

### **Diamond Pattern Explanation:**
- A diamond shape is created using `*` characters.
- The upper part of the diamond starts with one `*` and gradually expands outward, while the lower part mirrors the upper part.
  
### **Butterfly Pattern Explanation:**
- A butterfly shape consists of two mirrored triangular patterns.
- The upper wings of the butterfly expand outward, while the lower wings gradually close inward to form the butterfly shape.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Control flow using nested loops.
- Conditional formatting to create symmetry.
- Dynamic pattern generation based on user input.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 41/`
  - `DiamondAndButterflyPattern.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac DiamondAndButterflyPattern.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java DiamondAndButterflyPattern
   ```
3. Enter the number of rows, and the program will print both the Diamond and Butterfly patterns.

## 🔍 Example Output

For 5 rows:

### Diamond Pattern:
```plaintext
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *
```

### Butterfly Pattern:
```plaintext
*       *
**     **
***   ***
**** ****
**********
**** ****
***   ***
**     **
*       *
```


**Day 41 complete!** It was exciting to visualize patterns with loops and conditionals.
