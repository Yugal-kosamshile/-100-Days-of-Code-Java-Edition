# Day 18: Power of a Number

## 📝 Description

On Day 18 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I focused on writing a Java program to calculate the power of a number. The program takes two inputs from the user: the base and the exponent. It then computes the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent and displays it.

### **Objective:**
- Practice handling user input and performing arithmetic operations.
- Learn to use the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of a number.

## 🚀 Code Overview

The program prompts the user for the base and exponent. It then uses the built-in `Math.pow()` function to compute the power and outputs the result. The program works with decimal numbers and handles both positive and negative exponents.

### **1. Power Calculator**
This program calculates the result of a base number raised to a given exponent using the following formula:
```
result = base ^ exponent
```

- The program takes two user inputs: the base number and the exponent.
- It uses the `Math.pow(base, exponent)` method to compute the result.
- The result is printed to the console.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day18/`
  - `PowerCalculator.java`: Contains the Java program to calculate the power of a number.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac PowerCalculator.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java PowerCalculator
   ```

3. **Input the base and exponent as prompted.**

## 🔍 Example Output

### **Example 1:**
```plaintext
Enter the base number: 5
Enter the exponent: 3
5.0 raised to the power of 3.0 is: 125.0
```

### **Example 2:**
```plaintext
Enter the base number: 2
Enter the exponent: 4
2.0 raised to the power of 4.0 is: 16.0
```
