# Day 32: Linear Search Algorithm

## 📝 Description

On Day 32 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that implements the Linear Search algorithm to find a specific element in an array.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to implement the Linear Search algorithm.
- Practice working with arrays and basic searching techniques in Java.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter the number of elements in an array.
2. Allows the user to input the elements of the array.
3. Asks for the target value to search for in the array.
4. Implements Linear Search to find the target and returns its position or indicates if the value is not found.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Arrays and how to traverse them.
- Linear Search algorithm for finding elements.
- Basic control structures and input/output in Java.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 32/`
  - `LinearSearch.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac LinearSearch.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java LinearSearch
   ```
3. **Input the array elements and the target value** to search for, and the program will output the index of the target or notify that it wasn't found.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 
5
Enter the elements: 
12 34 23 56 9
Enter the target value to search for: 
23
23 found at index 2
```
