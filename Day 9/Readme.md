# Day 9: Reverse of a Given Number

## 📝 Description

On Day 9 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that reverses a given integer. This program demonstrates how to manipulate numbers and work with loops.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to extract digits from a number.
- Practice using loops to construct a reversed number.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. Extracts each digit from the number using the modulus operator (`%`).
3. Constructs the reversed number by appending each extracted digit.
4. Prints the reversed number to the console.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Looping structures (`while` loop) in Java.
- Using the modulus (`%`) and division (`/`) operators for digit extraction.
- Building numbers from digits.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 9/`
  - `ReverseGivenNO.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac ReverseGivenNO.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java ReverseGivenNO
   ```
3. **Enter a number** when prompted to see its reverse.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the Number: 1234
The Reverse of the Given number is : 4321
```
