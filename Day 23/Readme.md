# Day 23: Count Vowels and Consonants in a String

## 📝 Description

On Day 23 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I focused on writing a Java program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string. The program takes a string input from the user and counts the occurrences of each vowel and consonant.

### **Objective:**
- Practice string manipulation and character counting in Java.
- Learn how to differentiate between vowels and consonants.

## 🚀 Code Overview

The program prompts the user to enter a string. It then iterates through each character of the string, checking if it is a vowel or consonant, and updates the corresponding counts. Finally, it displays the counts of vowels and consonants.

### **1. Vowel and Consonant Counter**

This program counts the vowels and consonants in a string using the following approach:
1. Traverse each character in the string.
2. Check if the character is a vowel or consonant.
3. Increment the respective count based on the check.


## 📂 File Structure
- `Day23/`
  - `CountVowelsConsonants.java`: Contains the Java program to count vowels and consonants in a string.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac CountVowelsConsonants.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java CountVowelsConsonants
   ```
3. **Input a string when prompted.**

## 🔍 Example Output

### **Example 1:**
```plaintext
Enter a string: Hello World
Number of vowels: 3
Number of consonants: 7
```

### **Example 2:**
```plaintext
Enter a string: Java Programming
Number of vowels: 5
Number of consonants: 8
```
