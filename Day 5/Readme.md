# Day 5: Relational Operators

## 📝 Description

On Day 5 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to demonstrate how relational operators work. The program compares two integer values using various relational operators and displays the results.

### **Objective:**
- Understand the usage and behavior of relational operators in Java.
- Practice using relational operators to compare values.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Initializes two integer variables.
2. Compares these variables using relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
3. Prints the results of these comparisons to the console.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Relational operators in Java (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
- Printing boolean results of relational operations.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 5/`
  - `Relational.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac Relational.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java Relational
   ```
3. **View the output** to see how relational operators compare the values.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
a == b is : true
a != b is : false
a < b is : false
a > b is : false
a <= b is : true
a >= b is : true
```
