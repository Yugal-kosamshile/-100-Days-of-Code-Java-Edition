# Day 25: Convert Decimal to Binary

## 📝 Description

On Day 25 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that converts a decimal number into its binary equivalent. This task focuses on practicing number system conversions and understanding how binary numbers work.

### **Objective:**
- Convert a decimal number (base 10) to a binary number (base 2) using iterative division by 2.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter a decimal number.
2. Uses a loop to repeatedly divide the number by 2 and appends the remainders (either 0 or 1) to form the binary equivalent.
3. Outputs the binary representation of the decimal number.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Number system conversions (Decimal to Binary).
- Basic arithmetic operations like division and modulus.
- String manipulation for constructing the binary number.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day25/`
  - `DecimalToBinary.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac DecimalToBinary.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java DecimalToBinary
   ```
3. **Input a decimal number** when prompted, and the program will print the binary equivalent.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter a decimal number: 10
The binary equivalent is 1010
```
