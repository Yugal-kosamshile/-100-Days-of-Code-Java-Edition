# Day 10: Multiplication Table

## 📝 Description

On Day 10 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that prints the multiplication table of a number entered by the user. The program currently prints the table for the number 2.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to use loops to generate repeated output.
- Practice user input handling and basic arithmetic operations.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Uses a `while` loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
2. Prints the multiplication table for the number 2.
3. Displays each line of the table in the format: `counter * 2 = result`.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- `while` loops for repeated execution.
- Basic multiplication and string concatenation.
- Outputting results to the console.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 10/`
  - `TableOfN.java`: The main Java program to print the table for the number N.
  - `tableOf2.java`: The main Java program to print the table for the number 2.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac TableOfN.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java TableOfN
   ```
3. **View the output** to see the multiplication table for the number 2.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext```    
Enter a number: 7
1 * 7 = 7
2 * 7 = 14
3 * 7 = 21
4 * 7 = 28
5 * 7 = 35
6 * 7 = 42
7 * 7 = 49
8 * 7 = 56
9 * 7 = 63
10 * 7 = 70
