# Day 8: Leap Year Checker

## 📝 Description

On Day 8 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.

### **Objective:**
- Understand how to determine leap years using conditions.
- Practice using logical operators and modular arithmetic.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Takes a year as input from the user.
2. Applies the rules for leap years:
   - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
   - However, if it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
3. Outputs whether the year is a leap year or not based on the conditions.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Leap year calculation logic.
- Conditional statements and logical operators.
- User input handling with the `Scanner` class.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 8/`
  - `LeapYearChecker.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac LeapYearChecker.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java LeapYearChecker
   ```
3. **Input a year** when prompted to see if it is a leap year.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the Year: 2024
2024 is a Leap Year
```
