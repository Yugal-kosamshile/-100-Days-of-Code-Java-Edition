# Day 45: Find the Missing Number in an Array

## 📝 Description

On Day 45 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to find the missing number in an array. The array contains integers from 1 to `n` with one number missing. The goal is to find the missing number.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to find a missing element from a sequence of numbers.
- Practice array manipulation and arithmetic operations.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts an array of integers from the user.
2. Assumes the array contains numbers from 1 to `n` with one missing number.
3. Calculates the missing number and displays it.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Using the sum formula for natural numbers.
- Efficiently finding the missing number by comparing expected sum with the actual sum.
- Array traversal and basic arithmetic operations.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 45/`
  - `FindMissingNumber.java`: The main Java program to find the missing number in an array.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac FindMissingNumber.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java FindMissingNumber
   ```
3. **Enter an array of integers** with one missing number from a sequence to find the missing number.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements (n): 5
Enter the elements of the array (from 1 to n, with one missing): 1 2 4 5
The missing number is: 3
```
