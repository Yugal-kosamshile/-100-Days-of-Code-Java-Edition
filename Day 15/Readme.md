# Day 15: Sum of Even and Odd Integers

## 📝 Description

On Day 15 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that reads a set of integers and calculates the sum of even and odd integers separately. This task helps in understanding conditional logic and loops in Java.

### **Objective:**
- Practice using loops and conditional statements.
- Learn how to separate and sum even and odd numbers in a list of integers.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter the number of integers they wish to input.
2. Reads the set of integers from the user.
3. Calculates and prints the sum of the even integers and the sum of the odd integers.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- `for` loop for iterating over a set of inputs.
- Conditional statements (`if-else`) to check if a number is even or odd.
- Basic arithmetic operations to accumulate the sums.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 15/`
  - `sumEvenOdd.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac sumEvenOdd.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java sumEvenOdd
   ```
3. **Enter the number of integers** and then input the integers when prompted.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of integers: 5
Enter 5 integers: 1 2 3 4 5
Sum of Odd Integers: 9
Sum of Even Integers: 6
```
