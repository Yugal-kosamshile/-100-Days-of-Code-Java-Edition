# Day 36: Armstrong Number Check

## 📝 Description

On Day 36 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that checks whether a given number (in this case, `371`) is an Armstrong number.

An **Armstrong number** (or narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, `371` is an Armstrong number because `3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371`.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to break down a number into its digits.
- Practice using loops and conditional logic in Java.
- Compute powers of digits and check if a number is Armstrong.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Stores a given number (`371`) in a variable.
2. Calculates how many digits the number has.
3. Computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
4. Checks if the sum equals the original number.
5. Outputs whether the number is an Armstrong number.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Using loops to break a number into digits.
- Calculating the power of digits.
- Conditional statements to check if the number is an Armstrong number.
- Basic arithmetic and control flow in Java.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 36/`
  - `Armstrong.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac Armstrong.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java Armstrong
   ```
3. The program will automatically check if `371` is an Armstrong number and display the result.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Number is: 371
Power is: 3
Sum is: 371
371 is an Armstrong Number
```
