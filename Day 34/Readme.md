# Day 34: Binary Search Algorithm

## 📝 Description

On Day 34 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program that implements the Binary Search algorithm. Binary Search is a more efficient searching algorithm than linear search, working on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to implement the Binary Search algorithm.
- Understand how to work with sorted arrays and improve search efficiency.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Prompts the user to enter a sorted array of integers.
2. Asks the user for the target value to search for.
3. Implements Binary Search to find the target and returns its position or indicates if the value is not found.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Binary Search algorithm for fast searching.
- Recursion and iterative control structures.
- Handling sorted arrays in Java.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 34/`
  - `BinarySearch.java`: The main Java program.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac BinarySearch.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java BinarySearch
   ```
3. **Input a sorted array and the target value** to search for, and the program will output the index of the target or notify that it wasn't found.

## 🔍 Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 
5
Enter the elements in sorted order: 
12 23 34 45 56
Enter the target value to search for: 
34
34 found at index 2
```
