# Day 46: Find the Median of an Array

## 📝 Description

On Day 46 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I wrote a Java program to find the median of an array. The median is the middle value of a sorted array. If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element; if it has an even number, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

### **Objective:**
- Learn how to sort an array and find the median.
- Practice array manipulation, sorting algorithms, and median calculation.

## 🚀 Code Overview

This Java program:
1. Accepts an array of integers from the user.
2. Sorts the array in ascending order.
3. Calculates and displays the median value.

### **Concepts Covered:**
- Sorting an array using built-in methods.
- Handling even and odd-length arrays for median calculation.
- Efficient array manipulation and sorting techniques.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Day 46/`
  - `FindMedianOfArray.java`: The main Java program to find the median of an array.
  - `README.md`: This description file.

## 📋 How to Run
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac FindMedianOfArray.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java FindMedianOfArray
   ```
3. **Enter an array of integers** to see the median.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 5
Enter the elements of the array: 7 2 1 6 3
The median is: 3
```

If the array has an even number of elements:
```plaintext
Enter the number of elements in the array: 4
Enter the elements of the array: 1 2 7 8
The median is: 4.5
```
